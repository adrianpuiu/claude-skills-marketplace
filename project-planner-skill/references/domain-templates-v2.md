Task Breakdown
The task breakdown outlines major development and implementation phases for building the architecture:
Requirements Analysis: Gather and document all functional and non-functional requirements.
Design Phase: Create detailed architecture designs and select appropriate technologies for each component.
Infrastructure Setup: Provision cloud or on-premise infrastructure, networks, and base environment (including CI/CD pipelines).
Component Development: Develop or configure each system component (services, databases, UI, etc.) according to design.
Integration: Integrate components and services, including APIs, messaging, and data flows between subsystems.
Testing: Perform unit, integration, performance, and security testing on components and end-to-end workflows.
Deployment: Deploy the system to production environments using defined deployment patterns (canary, blue-green).
Monitoring & Observability Implementation: Set up logging, monitoring, and alerting for the system.
Security and Compliance Audit: Ensure all security measures are in place and compliance requirements are met.
Documentation and Training: Prepare operational documentation and train teams on system usage and maintenance.
Testing
Testing strategies ensure the system meets all requirements and is robust. The approach includes:
Unit Testing: Developers write tests for individual components/functions to catch issues early.
Integration Testing: Verify that different modules and services work together as expected.
Performance Testing: Load and stress tests to validate system performance under expected and peak loads.
End-to-End Testing: Simulate real user workflows across the entire system.
